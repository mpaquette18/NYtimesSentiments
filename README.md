# NY Times Sentiments
A R project looking at New York Times headlines. This project took the headlines from the New York Times Archive API. The data is returned in a JSON file which we wrote a python program to iterate through and extract the headlines and date into a CSV file. Then it is put into an R data frame where it can be analyzed with the RSentiment package. The details of this projects findings can be read in the [FinalReport.pdf](FinalReport.pdf) document on this page.
